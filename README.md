2. Under Action, click Create Task. You will now see a window with various tabs that you should go through one after the other.

3. General: In the "General" tab you can give the task any name. Optionally, you can add a description. If you want to assign the task to a user, make the appropriate settings in the "Security Options" section. You should activate the option "Execute with the highest privileges" so that Windows can execute the task without prompting. Finally, configure the task for Windows 10.

4. Trigger: In the "Trigger" tab you specify the conditions according to which the task is to be carried out. Click on "New". Now you can set a schedule according to which the task should start.

5. Actions: Here you specify which file should be executed. Click on "New" and select the program file from your computer.

6. Conditions: You can make additional settings under "Conditions". Here you can keep the preset options. Only if you are using a laptop should you specify under "Energy" whether the task should be carried out on battery power.

7. Settings: In the "Settings" you can set security options so that the execution of the task can be canceled in the event of an error.
